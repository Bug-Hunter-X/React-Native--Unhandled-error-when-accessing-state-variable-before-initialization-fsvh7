This error occurs when you try to access a state variable before it has been initialized.  This commonly happens when you try to render a component that uses a state variable before the component has finished mounting, resulting in the variable being `undefined`.

**Example:**

```javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
      .then(response => response.json())
      .then(data => setData(data));
  }, []);

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>{data.name}</Text> {/* Error if data is null or undefined */}
    </View>
  );
};

```
